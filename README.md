# Analysis-of-evoked-activity
This code quantitatively compare two potentials related to auditory events to identify common and distinctive processes correlated with bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.
# Intructions to run this code 
Download the gdf file of subjects who were exposed to BETA binaural sounds. Using the code estimate the AERPs of the ACTIVITY EVOKED topic datasets for two conditions frequent stimuli: sensory process (exogenous components) infrequent stimuli: sensory and cognitive processing (exogenous and endogenous components)
Correlate the AERPs between both conditions for each of the electrodes with the normxcorrLinks to an external site command.
Identify the maximum and minimum correlation reached among the 22 available channels.
Graph the following graphs in a 2x2 figure. Maximum cross correlation. Graph of the 2 overlapping AERPs that have reached the maximum correlation minimal cross correlation. Graph of the 2 overlapping AERPs that have reached the minimum correlation
